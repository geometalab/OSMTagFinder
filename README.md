# Readme OSM TagFinder

A search engine for [OpenStreetMap](www.openstreetmap.org) tags. It uses [TagInfo](http://taginfo.openstreetmap.org), translation services  (german to english), thesaurs and an adapted domain-specific semantic net.

TagFinder was developed as part of a research project for the [Geometa Lab](http://www.hsr.ch/geometalab) (Prof. S. Keller) of the IFS at the University for Applied Sciences Rapperswil (HSR) end of 2014. 
The application is written in Python 2.7 and uses the Flask web framework. 

There's a demo prototype at [Heroku](http://tagfinder.herokuapp.com/) (in english and german) including a RESTful API.
